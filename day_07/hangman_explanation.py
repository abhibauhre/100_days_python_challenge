🎯 REAL LIFE ANALOGY:
Think of Hangman like a TV game show where:
- Host picks a secret word (chosen_words)
- Shows blank spaces for each letter (place_holder)
- Player guesses letters one by one
- Correct letters are revealed, wrong ones stay hidden

🔍 HOW YOUR PROGRAM WORKS (Using '{chosen_words}' as example):

1️⃣ WORD SELECTION:
   • Computer picks random word: '{chosen_words}'
   • Length calculated: {len(chosen_words)} letters

2️⃣ PLACEHOLDER CREATION:
   • Empty string: ''
   • Loop {len(chosen_words)} times, add '_' each time
   • Result: '{place_holder}'

3️⃣ USER GUESS PROCESSING:
   Let's say user guesses 'o':
   
   Step-by-step letter checking:
""")

# Demonstrate with 'o' guess
guess = 'o'
display = ""

for i, letter in enumerate(chosen_words):
    print(f"   Position {i}: Check '{letter}'")
    if letter == guess:
        display += letter
        print(f"      '{letter}' == '{guess}' → Add '{letter}' → display: '{display}'")
    else:
        display += "_"
        print(f"      '{letter}' != '{guess}' → Add '_' → display: '{display}'")

print(f"\n   Final display: '{display}'")

📊 YOUR HANGMAN PROGRAM FLOW:

START
  ↓
1. Import random module
  ↓
2. Create list of possible words: {some_names}
  ↓
3. Computer picks random word: '{chosen_words}'
  ↓
4. Calculate word length: {len(chosen_words)}
  ↓
5. Create placeholder with underscores: '{place_holder}'
  ↓
6. Show placeholder to player
  ↓
7. Ask player for letter guess
  ↓
8. Check each letter in secret word:
   • If letter matches guess → show letter
   • If letter doesn't match → show underscore
  ↓
9. Display result to player
  ↓
END

🎮 GAME MECHANICS:
• Secret word: Computer's hidden choice
• Placeholder: Visual representation with blanks
• Guess: Player's letter choice
• Display: Updated view showing correct guesses

🔧 KEY CONCEPTS USED:
✅ Lists: Storing word options
✅ Random: Picking random word
✅ Loops: Creating placeholders & checking letters
✅ Conditionals: Comparing guess with letters
✅ String operations: Building display string
